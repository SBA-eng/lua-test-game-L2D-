This is a small test game I made using Love2D for fun.

The game has a working ECS (Entity Component System), Tilemap, Animation States, UI/Userdata, Camera. Written entirely in Lua.  

Game is playable on Windows by cloning/downloading the repo and dragging 'the game' folder over the 'love' executable.

You can read, edit and test all the .lua game code directly inside the 'the game' if you wish.

LÃ–VE is an *awesome* framework you can use to make 2D games in Lua. It's free, open-source, and works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
